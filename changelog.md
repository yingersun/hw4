1.1) Added Google analytics tracking script to my website so I can view analytics about the amount of visitors my website receives and see demographic information about my visitors. The information that Google analytics provides to me is important because it gives me information about what devices my visitors use and I can use this information to better optimize my website for visitors (such as mobile visitors).

    <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-TX9LJMVYZ2"></script>
    <script>
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
      gtag('js', new Date());

      gtag('config', 'G-TX9LJMVYZ2');
    </script>

1.2) Added contact information (github, linkedin, and mailto link) icons onto my website so visitors can easily access my information and contact me.
